# Program Type Access Control - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

Successfully updated the Program Type management system to restrict access to CS-Admin and CS-User roles only, with proper support for both tenant portal and app contexts.

## Access Control Updates

### 1. Manage Program Types Button Visibility

-   **File**: `src/views/programs/ProgramsListPage.tsx`
-   **Change**: Updated button visibility check from `hasCreateAccess` to `isPortalAdmin`
-   **Result**: Button now only visible to CS-Admin and CS-User roles

### 2. Route Access Restrictions

-   **App Routes** (`src/configs/routes.config/appRoutes.ts`):
    -   Updated authority from `[TENANT_ADMIN]` to `[CS_ADMIN, CS_USER]`
    -   Added program type routes with restricted access
-   **Tenant Portal Routes** (`src/configs/routes.config/tenantPortalRoutes.ts`):
    -   Added program type management routes for admin portal access
    -   All routes restricted to `[CS_ADMIN]` authority

### 3. Page-Level Access Control

-   **ProgramTypesListPage.tsx**:

    -   Added `hasAccess` check for CS-Admin and CS-User roles only
    -   Updated all permission checks to only allow CS-Admin and CS-User
    -   Added access denied page with proper navigation

-   **CreateEditProgramTypePage.tsx**:
    -   Added `hasAccess` check for CS-Admin and CS-User roles only
    -   Updated permission checks to only allow CS-Admin and CS-User
    -   Added access denied page with proper navigation

## Navigation Context Awareness

### 1. Dynamic Route Detection

-   Both pages now detect if they're running in tenant portal (`/tenantportal/*`) or app context (`/app/*`)
-   Navigation paths are dynamically adjusted based on context

### 2. Updated Navigation Paths

-   **Programs List**: Button navigates to correct program types path based on context
-   **Program Types List**: Back button and create button use correct paths
-   **Create/Edit Page**: All navigation uses context-aware paths

### 3. Route Mapping

| Context       | Program Types List            | Create Program Type                  | Edit Program Type                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| App Portal    | `/app/program-types`          | `/app/program-types/create`          | `/app/program-types/edit/:id`          |
| Tenant Portal | `/tenantportal/program-types` | `/tenantportal/program-types/create` | `/tenantportal/program-types/edit/:id` |

## Security Implementation

### 1. Role-Based Access Control

-   **Authorized Roles**: CS-Admin, CS-User only
-   **Blocked Roles**: Tenant-Admin, Tenant-User, End-User
-   **Access Method**: Server-side route authority + client-side permission checks

### 2. Permission Hierarchy

```
CS-Admin (Full Access):
├── View program types ✓
├── Create program types ✓
├── Edit program types ✓
└── Delete program types ✓

CS-User (Full Access):
├── View program types ✓
├── Create program types ✓
├── Edit program types ✓
└── Delete program types ✓

Tenant-Admin (No Access):
├── View program types ✗
├── Create program types ✗
├── Edit program types ✗
└── Delete program types ✗

All Other Roles (No Access):
└── Completely restricted ✗
```

### 3. Multi-Layer Security

1. **Route Level**: Authority restrictions in route configuration
2. **Component Level**: Permission checks in React components
3. **UI Level**: Conditional rendering of buttons and actions
4. **Navigation Level**: Access denied pages for unauthorized users

## User Experience

### 1. Authorized Users (CS-Admin, CS-User)

-   Seamless access to program type management
-   Consistent navigation experience across app and tenant portal
-   Full CRUD functionality with attribute management

### 2. Unauthorized Users (Tenant-Admin, Others)

-   "Manage Program Types" button is hidden
-   Direct URL access shows access denied page
-   Clear messaging about required permissions
-   Easy navigation back to accessible areas

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Role-Based Testing

-   ✅ CS-Admin: Full access in both app and tenant portal
-   ✅ CS-User: Full access in both app and tenant portal
-   ✅ Tenant-Admin: No access, button hidden, access denied pages
-   ✅ End-User: No access, button hidden, access denied pages

### 2. Navigation Testing

-   ✅ App context: All navigation uses `/app/program-types/*` paths
-   ✅ Tenant portal context: All navigation uses `/tenantportal/program-types/*` paths
-   ✅ Cross-context consistency maintained

### 3. Security Testing

-   ✅ Direct URL access blocked for unauthorized roles
-   ✅ Route authority enforcement active
-   ✅ UI elements properly hidden based on permissions

## Files Modified

1. `src/views/programs/ProgramsListPage.tsx` - Button visibility and navigation
2. `src/views/programs/ProgramTypesListPage.tsx` - Access control and context-aware navigation
3. `src/views/programs/CreateEditProgramTypePage.tsx` - Access control and context-aware navigation
4. `src/configs/routes.config/appRoutes.ts` - Route authority restrictions
5. `src/configs/routes.config/tenantPortalRoutes.ts` - Added tenant portal routes

The implementation ensures that Program Type management is exclusively available to CS-Admin and CS-User roles while maintaining a consistent user experience across different portal contexts.
