# Feature Toggles API Requirements Document

## Project Overview

Implementation of a feature toggle system that allows Portal Administrators (CS-Admin) to control tenant access to specific menu features and functionalities. The system will distinguish between free features (always enabled) and paid features (controlled access).

## Backend Development Requirements

### 1. Database Implementation

#### Required Tables

1. **Features Master Table**

    - Store all available system features
    - Track feature metadata (name, description, category, menu path)
    - Support feature activation/deactivation

2. **Tenant Feature Assignments**

    - Link tenants to their enabled features
    - Track who enabled/disabled features and when
    - Support bulk operations

3. **Feature Audit Log**
    - Complete audit trail of all feature changes
    - Track user actions, timestamps, and reasons
    - Support compliance and reporting requirements

#### Database Constraints

-   Unique constraint on TenantId + FeatureId combination
-   Foreign key relationships with proper cascading
-   Indexes on frequently queried columns (TenantId, FeatureId, FeatureKey)

### 2. REST API Development

#### Core Endpoints Required

**Feature Management (CS-Admin Only):**

-   `GET /api/Features` - List all system features
-   `POST /api/Features` - Create new feature
-   `PUT /api/Features/{id}` - Update existing feature
-   `DELETE /api/Features/{id}` - Delete feature

**Tenant Feature Management (CS-Admin Only):**

-   `GET /api/Tenants/{tenantId}/Features` - Get tenant's feature assignments
-   `POST /api/Tenants/{tenantId}/Features/{featureId}/enable` - Enable feature for tenant
-   `POST /api/Tenants/{tenantId}/Features/{featureId}/disable` - Disable feature for tenant
-   `POST /api/Tenants/{tenantId}/Features/bulk-update` - Bulk enable/disable features

**User Access Endpoints (All Users):**

-   `GET /api/User/Features` - Get current user's available features
-   `GET /api/User/Features/{featureKey}/access` - Check specific feature access

**Audit & Reporting (CS-Admin Only):**

-   `GET /api/Features/Audit` - Feature change audit log
-   `GET /api/Reports/FeatureUsage` - Feature usage analytics

#### API Response Standards

-   Consistent JSON response format with success/error indicators
-   Proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
-   Standardized error messages and validation responses
-   Include pagination for list endpoints

### 3. Service Layer Implementation

#### Required Services

**IFeatureService**

-   CRUD operations for features
-   Feature validation and business rules
-   Integration with caching layer

**ITenantFeatureService**

-   Tenant feature assignment management
-   Auto-initialization of features for new tenants
-   Bulk operation support

**IFeatureAuditService**

-   Audit log creation and retrieval
-   Compliance reporting
-   Change tracking

#### Business Rules Implementation

-   Free features automatically enabled for all tenants
-   Paid features disabled by default
-   Feature changes logged with user context
-   Validation of feature dependencies

### 4. Authentication & Authorization

#### Required Components

**Role-Based Access Control:**

-   CS-Admin: Full feature management access
-   CS-User: Read-only access to tenant features
-   Tenant-Admin: Read access to own tenant features only
-   End-User: Read access to available features only

**Feature-Based Authorization:**

-   Custom authorization attribute for feature-gated endpoints
-   Middleware to check feature access on API calls
-   Integration with existing JWT authentication

**Security Requirements:**

-   Validate user permissions on every feature-related request
-   Prevent privilege escalation attempts
-   Log all authorization failures

### 5. Caching Implementation

#### Caching Strategy

-   Redis cache for feature lookups, set this up such that if there is redis cache we can easily configure and will still work perfectly without redis cache
-   Cache tenant feature assignments
-   Cache user available features
-   TTL of 1 hour for feature data

#### Cache Invalidation

-   Invalidate tenant cache when features change
-   Invalidate user cache when tenant features change
-   Support manual cache refresh via admin endpoint

#### Cache Keys Structure

```
tenant_features:{tenantId}
user_features:{userId}
features:all
feature_access:{userId}:{featureKey}
```
